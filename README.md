# Politician
In this app, users can create politicians who represent this country and explore them through various options.  
All the user has to do is enter the type and the attributes of the politician, and the user can choose many options to discover more about the politician. 
I created this app using Java, but I am planning on converting this app into a JS/ReactJS App.  
I used the Time and Date APIs to validate and generate the politician's birth and the year that they were swornIn to public office and or retired, and for other methods.
